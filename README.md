**‚ùóAttention‚ùó**
This project is designed to be run inside a Virtual Machine because of its reliance on a specific domain name. To access the website from your browser (either inside the VM or from your host machine), you will likely need to edit your /etc/hosts file and map the domain name to the VM's IP address. This allows your system to resolve the custom domain correctly during development or testing.

```
    nano /etc/hosts
```
Paste inside
```
    127.0.0.1 <your_domain_name>
```
7. Visit your site in browser
    ```
    https://<your_domain_name>.42.fr
    ```
